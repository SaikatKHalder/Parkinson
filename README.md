# Parkinson
A machine learning Based approach to detecting the presence of Parkisonâ€™s 
disease from spiral teats of patients. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
The dataset contains test of 195 people out of which 147 are suffering from 
disease and has 24 columns(name, mdvp:fo, mdvp:fhi, mdvp:flo, mdvp:jitter and 
so on). The data is in ASCII CSV format.
There are several classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random 
Forest, etc. to approach the problem statement. For this project, we have used 
SVM approach as it gave the best results as we will see further.
